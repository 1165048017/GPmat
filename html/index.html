<h1>Matlab Datasets Toolbox</h1>

This page describes the datasets toolbox for MATLAB available for <a href="http://ext.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~u0015/cgi-bin/downloadForm.cgi?toolbox=datasets">download here</a>. 


<h3>Release Information</h3>


<p>Current release is 0.121.

<h4>Release 0.12</h4>

<p>There seems to have been a problem in earlier releases in terms of where the datasets were placed. This has now (hopefully) been fixed using the datasetsDirectory command which returns the directory in which that command is placed. All the data should be placed in that directory.

<h4>Release 0.11</h4>

<p>A new data set has been added, motion capture in x,y,z, format of a run. This <a href="http://accad.osu.edu/research/mocap/mocap_data.htm">data</a> is from Ohio state's Advanced Computing Center fro the Arts and Design web-site.

The mapLoadData.m command has been added to load in data for regression and classification problems. 
<h4>Release 0.1</h4>

First release of the toolbox.

The toolbox currently contains two different files for loading datasets into matlab and a collection of matlab data sets.
