<h1>Matlab Kernel Toolbox</h1>

RELEASEINFORMATION

Added 'translate' kernel which allows wrapping of other kernels with a kernel that translates the input location. Useful for moving the non-stationarity around the input space.

<h3>Version 0.166</h3>

Added periodic version of RBF kernel (see Rasmussen and Williams pg 92 or Mackay's introduction to GPs (1998)) and periodic version of Gibbs's non-statinary kernel (see e.g. pg 93 of Rasmussen and Williams).

<h3>Version 0.165</h3>

Added flag which indicates whether or not a kernel is stationary. This can be used for speeding computations (stationary kernels have a constant diagonal). Also replaced calls to constraining functions with 'optimiDefaultConstraint' calls which return the default constraint (making it easier for the user to change).

<h3>Version 0.163</h3>

This release removes the stubs for several KernDiagGradX.m files, which
were confusing kernDiagGradX.m, which assumes they only exist if the function
is implemented. For the kernel types 'lin', 'poly', 'mlp', and their 'ard'
counter-types, these files existed but weren't yet implemented.


<h3>Version 0.162</h3>

Added the Gibbs's non-stationary kernel, the rational quadratic kernel and the Matern kernel with nu = 3/2 and nu = 5/2.

<h3>Verison 0.161</h3>

<p>Introduced the single input motif kernel for the GPSIM
toolbox. Also there is much more documentation, and a new file
kernelGenerator.py for creating the basic files for your own kernels. 

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This toolbox allows computation of several different kernels and their gradients. You can add kernels to the toolbox by creating versions of the relevant files. Once added, they can be tested using the <code>kernTest</code>. For example you can test the RBF kernel by writing

<p><code>&gt;&gt; kernTest('rbf')</code>

<p>There are several kernels implemented, the ones that are being maintained for the latest release are:

<p><code>
gibbs
gibbsperiodic
lin
linard
rbf
rbfard
rbfperiodic
matern32
matern52
ratquad
mlp
mlpard
poly
polyard
sim
white
whitefixed
bias
cmpnd
tensor (tensor kernels).
file (a kernel written in a file).
</code>

<p>A new kernel can be created using the compound kernel, <code>cmpnd</code> or the tensor kernel, <code>tensor</code>. The compound kernel is made up of sums of individual kernels. Most often you will need to create a kernel containing a base kernel (e.g. <code>rbf</code>) and adding a white noise kernel, <code>white</code> and perhaps a constant offset through the bias kernel <code>bias</code>. On initialisation most kernel parameters are set to 1. Exceptions are ARD scale parameters, the variance of the white and bias kernels and the weight and bias variances of the <code>mlp</code> kernels.
