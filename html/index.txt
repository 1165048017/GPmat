RELEASEINFORMATION


<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Current Release</h3>

Changes to the code for reading in priors written by C++ code.

<h4>Release 0.13</h4>

<p>This toolbox allows computation of several different prior distributions and their gradients. You can add distributions to the toolbox by creating versions of the relevant files. Once added, they can be tested using the <code>priorTest</code>. For example you can test the Gaussian prior

<p><code>&gt;&gt; priorTest('gaussian')</code>

<p>There are several prior models implemented, the mains ones that are being maintained for the latest release are:

<p><code>gaussian
gamma
</code>

These prior models are Gaussian (zero mean with precision 1), gamma (parameterised by a and b).
