The FGPLVM toolbox is a new implementation of the GP-LVM that uses the Pseudo-Input method of Snelson and Ghahramani (NIPS 2005) for sparsification and efficiency improvements. In the first release, only the projected latent variables approximation of Seeger et al is implemented. The toolbox also implements back-constraints as proposed by Lawrence and Quinonero-Candela
