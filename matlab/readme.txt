Please note that this toolbox requires MATLAB 7.0 or higher to run. The toolbox relies on the optimi and ndlutil toolboxes, available at http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~neil/optimi/downloadFiles and http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~neil/ndultil/downloadFiles/.

Version 0.142 Release Notes
---------------------------

Minor changes to the kernDisplay command and each command for the relevant sub kernels. New command allows spaces to be placed in front of the display so that the kernel can be better formated when displayed as part of a larger model.

Version 0.141 Release Notes
---------------------------

Included the kernGetVariance function for obtaining the `signal' associated with the kernel for use with the FGPLVM toolbox.

Version 0.14 Release Notes
--------------------------

Added computation of parameter gradients with respect to sub-matrices of the kernel matrix to allow for optimisation of inducing points.

Version 0.131 Release Notes
---------------------------

Added polynomial and polynomial ARD kernels for completeness (their use is not recommended in Gaussian processes). Added kernReadFromFID.m for reading in a kernel from a C++ written file.

Version 0.13 Release Notes
--------------------------

Added kernSetWhite as a helper function to set the level of white noise in the kernel.

General Overview
----------------

This toolbox implements the different kernels. At the time of writing two toolboxes make use of KERN, IVM vs 0.31 and FBD vs 0.2.

Interaction with the toolbox is done through the interface files which are prefixed by kern. The toolbox is designed to allow linear combinations of kernels with a minimum of fuss (using the cmpnd kernel).

The toolbox was spun out of the IVM toolbox, and most of the files are based on files in IVM 0.221.

Kernel Types
------------

Several example kernels are given:

     'ard' For backward compatability with the ard kernel in IVM 0.1. It combines linear and rbf ard kernels.

     'sqexp' For backwards compatability this is equivalent to the 'rbf' kernel in IVM 0.1.

     'mlp', 'mlpard' The multi-layer perceptron kernel from Williams' Computing with infinite networks paper. An ARD version is also provided.

     'rbf', 'rbfard' The standard radial basis function kernel and an ARD version.

     'lin', 'linard' A linear kernel and an ARD version.

     'white' Is just a white noise kernel. It is not designed to be used alone, but as an element in the compound kernel

     'bias' is for adding a bias variance term to the kernel (a positive offset) on it's own it is not a valid kernel.

     'cmpnd' The compound kernel is for creating new kernels which are linear combinations of other kernels.

The perl script for generating code for new kernels is kernelGenerator.pl

It is run with two arguments, the first is the short name for the noise model, e.g. rbf, the second is the long name, e.g. radial\ basis\ function.
