The FGPLVM toolbox is a new implementation of the GP-LVM that uses the Pseudo-Input method of Snelson and Ghahramani (NIPS 2005) for sparsification and efficiency improvements. In the first release, only the projected latent variables approximation of Seeger et al is implemented. The toolbox also implements back-constraints as proposed by Lawrence and Quinonero-Candela

Version 0.1
-----------

The first release containing a couple of examples on the oil data and dynamics. The toolbox can load in the C++ files with dynamics associated and (through the mocapResultsCppBvh in the MOCAP toolbox) can run motion capture files with dynamics.
